"""Tool-agnostic file I/O, locking, and path safety primitives.

These helpers were extracted from ``codex_session_toolkit.support`` so
``cc-clean`` (and future sibling tools) can share the same atomic-write,
advisory-lock, Windows-long-path, and case-insensitive-FS logic without
forking it. **No Codex-specific knowledge** lives here.

Invariants worth preserving when modifying:
* ``atomic_write`` opens its tempfile with ``newline=""`` so JSONL writers
  do not silently translate ``\\n`` → ``\\r\\n`` on Windows text mode.
* ``file_lock`` is **not reentrant** across separate fds on POSIX. Callers
  doing read-modify-write must pass ``lock_path=None`` to ``atomic_write``
  to avoid self-deadlock.
* ``replace_with_retry`` only retries on Windows — POSIX ``PermissionError``
  on ``os.replace`` is a real ownership problem, not a transient AV race.
